        <h1>The history of The Weekend</h1>

        <p>The Weekend was born in Toronto Canada. His parents split up when he was young and didnt see his dad often. This caused him to start doing drugs at a young age. He dropped out of high school which is what inspired his stage name. He first made music and uploaded it through YouTube in 2010 with a producer. His first three songs were "What You Need", "loft Music", and "The Morning". He would release more music over the years but the album that would make him famous was Beauty Behind the Madness.</p>
